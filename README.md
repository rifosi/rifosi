- 👋 Hi, I’m @rifosi, a brazilian luthier and entrepreneur
- 👀 I’m interested in develop acoustical musical instruments (guitars, to start), incorporating a digital signal processing chain inside them, to shape soundwaves into different forms and behaviors
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Juce, electronics, Arduino, acoustical foundations of music, and more advanced math
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code development using C++ in acoustical-electronic experiments using Arduino with accelerometers and piezoelectric sensors and actuators
